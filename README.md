# 📊 ML Summative Project — Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a summative machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting salaries using a **Linear Regression Model**. The goal is to explore how variables like remote work ratio and work year affect salary, and to visualize these relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Analyze salary data using **linear regression**
- Visualize relationships between salary, work year, and remote ratio
- Understand trends and patterns through data visualization

---


---

## 📌 Key Features

✅ Cleaned and explored salary dataset  
✅ Applied **Linear Regression** using `sklearn`  
✅ Created multiple data visualizations using **Seaborn**  
✅ Focused on meaningful variables: `salary_in_usd`, `work_year`, and `remote_ratio`  
✅ Removed irrelevant or noisy outputs for a cleaner analysis  
✅ Committed progressive improvements using Git

---

## 📊 Visualizations

You’ll find the following plots in the notebook:

- `remote_ratio vs salary_in_usd` scatterplot with regression line
- `work_year vs salary_in_usd` scatterplot
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features
- Histograms of salary distribution

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for regression modeling
- **Git** & **GitHub** for version control

---
